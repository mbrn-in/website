# The netlify.toml is a configuration file that specifies how Netlify builds and deploys your 
# site â€” including redirects, branch and context-specific settings, and more.

# There are other ways to accomplish some of the things you would use the
# netlify.toml for. For example, you can use _headers and _redirects files to accomplish what
# the filename suggests, but having these settings all live in the same file can
# greatly simplify maintaining them.
