As the 100th Birthday of Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba draws near, the Combined Summer Course 2025–26 at SSSIHL was held with renewed purpose and reverence across campuses. Rooted in Swami’s vision of integral education, the course brought together students and faculty from all campuses for a collective exploration of India’s spiritual and cultural heritage. Through thought-provoking talks, interactive sessions, and cultural presentations, participants engaged deeply with timeless Indian values, Vedantic thought, and the life and message of Bhagawan. This year’s course served as a meaningful reminder of the role of spirituality in personal development and in shaping a more compassionate society. It inspired students to reflect on their purpose, actions, and the path ahead—both as learners and as instruments of service. In this landmark year, the Summer Course stood as a fitting tribute to Swami’s life, legacy, and message of love and selfless service.
