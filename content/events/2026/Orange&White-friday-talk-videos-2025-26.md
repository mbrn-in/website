“Orange and White 2025–26” was an evening of heartfelt reflection and spiritual connection held at the SSSIHL Brindavan Campus Hostel. In the lead-up to Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba’s Centenary year, students came together in a sacred space to share personal moments, memories, and experiences that reflected their inner journey with Swami. With simplicity and sincerity, the evening was filled with stories of love, gratitude, and transformation—each echoing the deep bond between the students and Bhagawan. Through spoken reflections, creative expressions, and soulful moments, the program became a collective offering from the heart. “Orange and White” served not just as an event, but as a gentle reminder of Swami’s ever-guiding presence and the quiet strength that comes from living His message every day.
