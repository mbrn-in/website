The Farewell programme was a memoir in the diary of the graduating batch, the Maharshis. The Maharshis were first welcomed into the hostel prayer hall by the hostel inmates. The sophomores described their journey with the Maharshis and their learnings from them. A melody ruminating on the relationship with the Maharshis was a highlight on the day.
