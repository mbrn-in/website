The New Year was meant to be an event which would make each person bring out talents latent in them. Students were asked to write stories and the best one would actually be enacted through a small skit. Teachers were also invited to present a musical piece.  The New Year was built around the theme-"Dream. Work. Achieve" which was the single mantra for success.
