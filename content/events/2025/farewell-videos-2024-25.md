A chapter closes, but the memories remain etched forever. As we bid farewell, hearts are full — with pride, with gratitude, and with a touch of sadness. From early morning routines to late-night laughter, from shared dreams to silent prayers, every moment spent together in the hostel has woven a story that time can never erase.This is more than just goodbye — it’s a celebration of all that was lived, learnt, and loved. Though the journey in Brindavan may pause here, the spirit of this gurukula family lives on in every path ahead.
