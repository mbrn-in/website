In the morning, the students were engaged in packing food packets for Narayana Seva, the message for which our lord Sathya Sai stood for. It is in moments like these that the value of selfless service is instilled in students. In the evening, the prayer hall was radiating with gratitude and love as memories of the days of Sai's physical presence cascaded on each person after many soulful rendition of Stotrams.
